# Notes

Test Driven Design: if using Redux, this should be easier to do since most critical operations are done via pure functions.

TypeScript would be a good choice, especially for the backend, to ensure proper validation of data. (Interfaces for complex types, no null values allowed unless explicitly specified.)
